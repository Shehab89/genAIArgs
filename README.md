# Global Media Analysis of Generative AI: A Deep Dive into Regional Arguments

This research examines media discourse on Generative AI across Europe, North America, Asia, and the Middle East, utilizing controversy mapping to analyze regional perspectives and argumentative biases. Unlike traditional content analysis, this study employs an argument-mining approach. It first extracts arguments and their stances towards Generative AI, then identifies the top themes among these arguments in each region. A fine-tuned BERT model is used on cross-topic datasets (Reimers et al., 2019) to extract arguments and their stances. Additionally, KMeans is used to cluster the arguments and TF-IDF is employed to extract top themes per region. This methodology sheds light on regional differences in media narratives, enhancing our understanding of global perspectives on Generative AI and informing worldwide policy and AI ethics discussions.

This project analyzes media coverage of Generative AI, focusing on identifying regional arguments and stances towards this technology. It involves data cleaning, exploration, and classification using a pre-trained BERT model. Then, clusters text paragraphs based on their content and analyzes the stance expressed within each cluster. The code utilizes advanced NLP techniques, such as TFIDF, and SpaCy, and machine learning techniques, such as KMEANS, to achieve this.
